			<p>Part of Jeff's training plan, taking all the courses on tech
				used in CHV app (Angular + Spring MVC REST) and building out demo
				using everything else that seems to naturally come with (SpringBoot,
				Hibernate, Bootstrap, JQuery)</p>

			<p>Eventually want to get familiar enough with all this,
				including Node.js, to take on all the interesting stuff confronted
				with when trying out JHipster.</p>

			<p>Jeff's typical approach: training is ok but unless I build
				some kind of working prototype from examples and tutorials, I'll
				never really pick it all up.</p>

			<p>Have learned by now to start small and build from online
				examples, tackling one problem at a time, leaving URLs in the
				comments from where I found stuff, commenting out stuff that didn't
				work right, etc</p>
